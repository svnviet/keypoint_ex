Veritas Key Point Assessment 

Repo structure:

*  dataset folder contains the raw images
*  the file keypoint_labels.json contains the labels for those images

The goal is to create a model to predict the labels for images

You will be assessed on:

*  Code and visualization quality (especially in exploring the data and writing organized, production level code)
*  Feature generation/model creation/analysis flow/methodology
*  Validation method(s)/metrics/statistics/plots
*  Conclusions / recommendations - are we data limited, noise limited, overfitting/underfitting? How would you improve the model? i.e. I don't particularly care if the model is optimally tuned so long as you know where it can be improved and how much a bump you might expect.

Please submit a jupyter notebook (with additional trained model files, inference script and instruction to use it i.e. how do I test your model with a new image?)

Your submission should be in form of a pull request to the master branch of this repo. Once you make the pull request, email me and I will review the PR and merge it.
